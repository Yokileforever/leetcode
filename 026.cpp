 * Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2]'
 *
 * 
 * Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element
 * appear only once and return the new length.
 * 
 * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
 * the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given nums = [1,1,2],
 * 
 * Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
 * being 1 and 2 respectively.
 * It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
